## What is this?

Since I've wanted to learn golang for quite a while now,
I decided that it was finally time to take the plunge and start out by working through the book "Learn Go With Tests".

I'll put this on git to (1.) track my progress, (2.) have a place to store my notes & (3.) have something I can look back on in the future.

Fun fact: 
I started learning GO while waiting for a delayed plane to take me to SFO to participate at the 2024 Google I/O.
What better time to pick up GO than on your way to a google event! (Well, at least I hope I will be on my way soon as I've already tried out all drink options at the HND SkyLounge and am slowly but surely getting impatient)
